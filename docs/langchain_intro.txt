LangChain is a Python framework that simplifies the development of applications powered by large language models (LLMs). It provides components for integrating LLMs with data sources, tools, and chains of logic.

LangChain supports document loaders, embeddings, retrievers, agents, memory, and more. It is commonly used to build applications such as chatbots, document question answering systems, and AI agents.

One of LangChainâ€™s popular use cases is implementing RAG pipelines by combining document retrievers and LLMs.
